## Imaginary Numbers
Before Tartaglia imaginary numbers had been ignored simply because they had no obvious connection to geometry; they just weren't useful for measuring anything.  For instance, an irrational real number like $\sqrt{2}$ can be viewed as the length of the diagonal of a unit square, but no part of a square corresponds to the imaginary number $\sqrt{-2}$.  

But Tartaglia's method required square roots of negative numbers, even in some cases where all the solutions turned out to be real numbers.  This forced mathematicians to develop rules for working with and visualizing these new numbers, a process that took hundres of years.{{% sidenote "Cardano" %}}Gerolamo Cardano, who published Tartaglia's methods in 1545, wrote that working with imaginary numbers involved "mental tortures." {{% /sidenote %}}

It was the Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler (1707-1783) who introduced the notation $i=\sqrt{-1}$ that we use today.  The imaginary unit $i$ has the special property that $i^2=-1$.   

Any multiple of $i$ is an **imaginary number**.  For instance $2.5i$ and $-18i$ are both imaginary numbers.  

The square root of a negative number is always an imaginary number and can be rewritten as

\[\sqrt{-x} = \sqrt{x} \thinspace i\]

For example, $\sqrt{-9 \}$ and $\sqrt{-5 \}$ are the imaginary numbers $3 i$ and $\sqrt{5}\,i$.

## Complex Numbers
By combining the real numbers with the imaginary numbers we can construct an even larger set called the **complex numbers**.  Every complex number can be written as

\[ z=\color{red}{a}+\color{blue}{b} i \]

where $\color{red}{a}$ is the real part and $\color{blue}{b}$ is the imaginary part.  This set includes numbers like   $\color{red}{3}\color{blue}{-2}i$ and $\color{red}{1}+\color{blue}{6}i$.

Any real number can be expressed in complex form, as can every purely imaginary number.  For instance, the real number $5$ can be written in complex form as $\color{red}{5}+\color{blue}{0}i$ where the imaginary part is $\color{blue}{0}$.  And the purely imaginary number $\color{blue}{4}i$ can be written as $\color{red}{0} + \color{blue}{4}i$ where the real part is $\color{red}{0}$.

## Visualizing Complex Numbers
Since each complex number $z=a+b i$ has two parts, a real part $a$ and an imaginary part $b$, it is natural to identify it with the point $(a, b)$.  

By using the horizontal axis for the real part and the vertical for the imaginary part, we change the standard x-y pane into the **complex plane**.  Every complex number matches up with a point in the complex plane, and every point corresponds to a complex number.

As an example, the complex number $-2+i$ is represented by the point $(-2, 1)$.

## Graph Complex Valued Functions
Complex valued functions can also be graphed on a complex plane.  One way to do this is to draw an arrow between an input $z$ and its output $f(z)$.

Suppose, for example, that $f(z)=z^2-1$.  If we choose $z = -2 + i$ as our input, then we have

\[
\begin{align}
f(-2 + i) &= (-2 + i)^2-1 \newline
&= (-2 + i)(-2 + i)-1 && \text{since } (-2 + i)^2 = (-2 + i)(-2 + i) \newline
&= (4-2i-2i+i^2)-1 && \text{expanding } (-2 + i)(-2 + i) \newline
&= (4-2i-2i-1)-1 && \text{because } i^2 = -1 \newline
&= (3-4i)-1 && \text{combine like terms} \newline
&= 2-4i && \text{simplify}
\end{align}
\]

as the output value.  This particular input-output pair is shown in the interactive figure below.

{{% geogebra ratio="50%" id_1="zz8FMRzvtfze1pSP" id_2="yeevacaw" id_m="qsjhnxhs" %}}

The main disadvantage of this technique is that it only shows one input-output pair at a time, which makes it difficult to understand exactly what the whole function is doing.

## Domain Coloring
Another way to visualize complex valued functions was developed in the 1990's and it allows us to see the entire function.  Rather than drawing an arrow to show what happens to a particular point, this method uses colors.  

The goal is to give each complex number its own color.  To do this we cover the complex plane with a color map{{% sidenote "color map"%}}The color map we will use looks like this ![color map](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_map.png){{% /sidenote %}} that spans the whole spectrum of colors.  A point is lighter if it is closer to the origin and darker if it is farther away, with the origin itself $(0, 0)$ being bright white.

With this method we visualize the function by coloring $z$ based on where $f(z)$ is on the color map.  

For instance, we calculated earlier that if $f(z)=z^2-1$, then $f(-2+i)=2-4i$.  Since the color map puts $2 - 4i$ in the purple region, we color our original point **$\color{#9C0973}{-2 + i}$** purple.

If we combine this idea with the earlier arrow diagram, then the arrow will point to the color that should be used for $z$.

If we keep track of the color of each point then the entire domain can be colored, giving us a more complete picture of the function.  

These graphs are called **domain coloring graphs** of a complex function, and look very different from the graphs you are used to drawing by hand or creating on a graphing calculator.  

Since creating a domain coloring graph requires a computer graphics program, you will not be expected to make them on your own.  But we will use them in this section to discover some useful facts about polynomials.

## Identify Real and Imaginary Zeros
Domain coloring graphs are especially helpful in identifying the zeros of functions like polynomials.  Since you will be required to identify zeros from a domain coloring graph, we should review the definition of a zero.

Remember that a number $c$ is a zero of a function if $f(c)=0$.  If $c$ is a real number then we call it a **real zero** of the function.   

Imaginary numbers can also be zeros of a function.  If $c$ is an imaginary number and $f(c)=0$, then it is an **imaginary zero** of the function.

{{% /check %}}


The key to identifying zeros visually from a domain coloring graph is to realize that the number $0$ corresponds to the origin $(0, 0)$ in the complex plane.

Since the origin in our color map is a white point at the center of all the colors, the zeros of a function will have a similar appearance.  In other words, we can find the zeros by looking for bright white points surrounded by all the colors.

Take a look at this domain coloring graph of the function $f(z)=z^2-1$, which is a higher-resolution copy of the graph you made a moment ago.  

![](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_Z_squared_minus_1.png#center)

There are two bright white points, one at $(-1, 0)$ and another at $(1, 0)$, corresponding to the complex numbers $-1+0i=-1$ and $1+0i=1$.  This means that the function $f(z)=z^2-1$ has real zeros of $-1$ and $1$.  Real zeros, such as these, will always be found along the real axis of a domain coloring graph.

Imaginary zeros also show up on domain coloring graphs as bright white points.  For instance, in this graph of $f(z)=z^2-4z+5$, the points $(2, 1)$ and $(2, -1)$ are bright white points where all the colors meet.  

![](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_z2-4z+5.png#center)

That means the zeros are the imaginary numbers $2+i$ and $2-i$.

1.  Use this domain coloring graph to find the zeros of $f(z)=z^2+1$. {{% answer %}}Since the white points are at $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$, the zeros must be $i$ and $-i$.{{% /answer %}}   
{{% /check %}}


It's possible for a function to have a mixture of real zeros and imaginary zeros.  In an earlier Quick Check we saw that the zeros of  $f(z)=z^{3}+z^2+z+1$ are $z=-1,$ $z=i$ and $z=-i$.  These three zeros are visible in the domain coloring graph as the points $(-1, 0)$, $(0, 1)$ and $(0,-1)$.

![](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_v_standard.png#center)

However, if we plot the equivalent polynomial $p(x)=x^{3}+x^{2}+x+1$ on a standard graph, only the real zero (x-intercept) at $x-1$ is visible.  Imaginary zeros are never visible on standard real-valued graphs.


## The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
With a domain coloring graph we can easily count the number of real and imaginary zeros of a function.  Remember, if the zero is on the real axis, then it is a real zero.  If it is anywhere else, it is imaginary.

You may not have realized it, but each of the functions in the previous Quick Check was a polynomial.  Since we are interested in understanding polynomials, let's look at those same graphs again.  This time, pay attention to the degree of the polynomial as well the number of zeros.

{{% check %}}

After looking at those graphs a second time you might have noticed a connection between the zeros and the degree of the polynomial.
