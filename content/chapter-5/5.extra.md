Height given initial vertical velocity $vy_0$:  $h(t)=-\frac{1}{2}gt^2+vy_0t+h_0$
Position if launched horizontally, so $vy_0=0$ with horizontal velocity $vx_0$:  $h(x) = -\frac{1}{2}g\left(\frac{x}{vx_0}\right)^2 + h_0$

Trajectory:  $y = ()\tan \theta)x - \frac{gx^2}{2(v_0 \cos \theta)^2}

* Horizontal & vertical motion are independent.
* Horizontal velocity is assumed to be constant (ignoring air resistance)
* Vertical velocity is constantly decreasing, having a maximum at the instant it is launched.
* Vertical velocity component is $v_y = \sin \theta \times |\vec v|$
* Horizontal velocity component is $v_x = \cos \theta \times |\vec v|$

## Projectile Motion
Early theories based on Aristotle's philosophy assumed that a thrown object would travel in a straight line and then suddenly drop straight to the ground.  It was Galileo who proved in 1609 that the shape had to be a parabola.{{% sidenote "Galileo"%}}Drawings from [Galileo's notebook](https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Galileo_Prototype/HTML/F116_V/F116_V.HTM) showing results of his free fall experiments, dating from about 1609. ![Folio 116v from Galileo's notebook](/img/chapter-5/Galileo_Notebook_C116_V.jpg){{% /sidenote %}}  

In Galileo's early experiments he rolled a ball down a ramp and off the edge of a table.  If you duplicate this experiment, then the trajectory of the falling ball, in meters, is described by the quadratic polynomial

$$y = \frac{- 4.9}{v^2} x^{2} + h$$

where $v$ is the initial horizontal speed of the ball, $h$ is the height of the table and $x$ is the horizontal distance the ball has traveled.  Keep in mind that while Galileo did this with a ball, it is also true for any projectile launched horizontally.

## Vertex Form
The function could even be rewritten in the **vertex form** $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$, which we used in [Chapter 1](/chapter-1/1.7/#vertex-form-of-a-quadratic) when we were modeling data by transforming the square function.

For example if $f(x)=3x^2+6x+1$ then the x-coordinate of the vertex is

\[
\begin{align}
h &=\frac{-b}{2a} \newline
&= \frac{-6}{(2)(3)} \newline
&= -1
\end{align}
\]

and the y-coordinate of the vertex is

\[
\begin{align}
k &= f(h) \newline
&= f(-1) \newline
&= 3(-1)^2+6(-1)+1 \newline
&= -2
\end{align}
\]

and the function could be rewritten as $f(x)=3(x+1)^2-2$.

## Other Models
* Metcalfe's Law on the "network effect", ie. how much something increases in value as more people use it.  reference http://novel.ict.ac.cn/zxu/JournalPDF/Zhang_JCST_2015.pdf  Data showed that Facebook's revenue is proportional to the square of the number of monthly active users.  Also data from China's Tencent company.  The formulas are

$$V_{\text{Facebook}} = 5.70 \times 10^{-9}\times n^2$$
$$V_{\text{Tencent}} = 7.39 \times 10^{-9}\times n^2$$

Where the value is in billions of dollars and n is number of monthly active users.

* Metcalfe's Netroid function sure looks a lot like a logistic function.  $N(t)=Netroid=\frac{p}{1+e^{-v(t-h)}$ where $N$ is the number of users, $p$ is the peak value representing the maximum value of the number of users, $v$ is the virality or speed with which adoption occurs, and $h$ is the point in time at which the growth rate is at a maximum-when the network has reached half the peak size.

## Cubic applications
* Also the reason why there are such MASSIVE structures holding up signs, especially in the Gulf Coast area. A 50 mph wind might 800 lbs of horizontal force on a billboard. A 100 mph wind would put 6400 lbs and a 125 would put 12,202 lbs of horizontal force.

* The drag of airplanes is essentially the coefficient of drag of the airframe (complete) times velocity cubed. So for a 10% increase in speed, it requires 1.13 more horse power (33.1% more horsepower)

* There exist cubic tweening functions; that is, for animations on computers, people sometimes use a cubic polynomial to ease (or smooth the animation).  Hermite cubics are ubiquitous in keyframing computer animations.

* the maximum power that can be generated by a wind turbine is proportional to the cube of the wind speed.

## Lagrange polynomials
Nice, simple example at https://brilliant.org/wiki/lagrange-interpolation/

Let $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ be mutually distinct numbers and we need to fit the polynomial of degree 3 passing through the points $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3),(x_4,y_4)$. Then

$$p(x)=L_1(x)y_1+L_2(x)y_2+L_3(x)y_3+L_4(x)y_4$$

where
$$L_1(x)=\frac{(x-x_2)(x-x_3)(x-x_4)}{(x_1-x_2)(x_1-x_3)(x_1-x_4)}$$
$$L_2(x)=\frac{(x-x_1)(x-x_3)(x-x_4)}{(x_2-x_1)(x_2-x_3)(x_2-x_4)}$$
$$L_3(x)=\frac{(x-x_1)(x-x_2)(x-x_4)}{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)(x_3-x_4)}$$
$$L_4(x)=\frac{(x-x_1)(x-x_2)(x-x_3)}{(x_4-x_1)(x_4-x_2)(x_4-x_3)}$$

In the rental business, it can be shown that the increase or decrease in the acquisition cost of an asset held for rental is related to the Return on Investment produced by the rental asset by a third order polynomial function.

rubber band catastrophe

sometimes we know the value of a function at a set of points x1, x2, \dotsc but we don't have an equation that lets us calculate its value at any arbitrary point.  The values might come from a physical measurement or from a long numerical calculation that cannot be cast into a simple functional form.

Interpolation is related to by distinct from *function approximation*.  In the case of interpolation you are **given** the function at points not of your choosing.  For the case of function approximation you are allowed to compute the function at any desired points for the purpose of developing the model.

In situations where continuity is a concern, one must use the "stiffer" interpolation provided by a so-called spline function.

polynomials in the creation of the surfaces,  polynomial surface patches   surface subdivision

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_%28mathematics%29

a cubic spline is a sequence of cubic polynomial curves joined end to end to represent a complex curve.  Each segment of the cubic spline is a parametric curve.

In mathematics, a spline is a sufficiently smooth polynomial function that is \piecewise-defined, and possesses a high degree of smoothness at the places where the polynomial \pieces connect (which are known as knots)

The geometric technique of subdivision surfaces allows artists to represent complex surfaces and complicated shapes efficiently on a computer, while maintaining an illusion of smoothness. Under many iterations of this split-and-average process, a faceted model converges to a smooth surface that can be easily animated. - See more at: http://www.maa.org/meetings/calendar-events/math-in-the-movies#sthash.N9T9nB6V.dpuf

We decided to use polynomials because they are commonly used to describe free form surfaces and supported by all CADsystems. There are three common representations of bivariate polynomial functions, namely TP-
B ́ezier-surfaces, TP-B-spline-surfaces, and B ́ezier-triangles. Since all three are equivalent, i. e.
conversion is possible without loss of information, we choose whatever representation is the most
practical for a specific purpose.

Key Frames
* In computer animation the workflow is basically the same. The animator creates the important frames of a sequence, then the software fills in the gap. For example, in Adobe Systems Flash, the animator can specify, in keyframes, the starting and ending position of an object, such as a circle. Flash smoothly translates the object from the starting point to the ending point. Similar to hand-drawn animation, this is called 'tweening. The animator can correct the result at any point, shifting keyframes back and forth to improve the timing and dynamics of a movement, or change an 'in between' into an additional keyframe to further refine the movement. One of the first applications of key frame animation was the award-winning 1974 animated short film, Hunger.


## 5.4-1-Notes
splines could lead to systems  http://people.cs.clemson.edu/~dhouse/courses/405/notes/splines.pdf


## 5.4-2
* Suppose you have a large number n of experimentally determined points, through which you want to pass a curve. There is a formula (the Lagrange interpolation formula) producing a polynomial curve of degree n −1 which goes through the points exactly. But normally one wants to ﬁnd a simple curve, like a line, parabola, or exponential, which goes approximately through the points, rather than a high-degree polynomial which goes exactly through them.

The reason is that the location of the points is to some extent determined by experimental error, so one wants a smooth-looking curve which averages out these errors, not a wiggly polynomial which takes them seriously.*



## Power Series ?  
can we tie those into polynomials?



## 5.1-5-Notes
all polynomials with the same degree and leading coefficient will look the same in the long run.
because as $x\rightarrow\pm\infty$, the degree dominates the smaller powers.  For instance, if $p(x)=1/2x^4-2x^{2}+x$, then term $1/2x^4$ will become much larger than the others as $x$ increases.
|  $x$  |   $1/2x^4$  |   $-2x^{2}$  |   $x$  |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1/2 | -2 | 1 |
| 10 |  5000 | -200 | 10 |
| 20 | 80000 | -800 | 20 |


## 5.1-12-Notes
In general, the *factored form* the equation of a polynomial will look like $p(x)=a(x-c_1)(x-c_2)(x-c_3)\dotsc(x-c_n)$ where $a$ is the leading coefficient and each $(x-c_i)$ is a factor for some number $c_i$.
 maybe include a leading coefficient in the applet? or would that detract from the point of the applet?

 ## 5.2-18-Notes
 A domain coloring graph also makes it easy to spot multiple zeros.  At a double zero, for instance, we will see a bright white point and the colors will cycle around it twice.  The colors will circle three times around a zero with a multiplicity of $3$.  
 As an illustration of this point, the functions below each have a zero at $(2, 0)$ with multiplicities of, respectively,  $2$, $3$, $4$ and $5$.

 *Polynomials and the solving of its roots have practical and widespread use in computer applications, the foremost of which is cryptography, or the encryption of sensitive data for sending over the internet. This is especially useful in banking transactions where secrecy and privacy of the individual customer is paramount. Polynomials can be used in public key encryption, as a means to encrypt information. The decryption of a polynomial is hence directly linked to the solvability of this polynomial. Only those with the required decryption key will get to know the real message behind the encrypted message. Being able to solve for a polynomials roots will enable one to create a decryption key, a nd hence solvability or the lack thereof of such
 a polynomial, is important in choosing a polynomial as a possible encryption key so that it cannot be hacked.*


 ## 5.3-2-Notes
 the point, aside from not getting yourself into duels, is that there are no formulas to memorize for each degree of polynomial.  if they are rational, use RZT and maybe quad form.  If not, use technology.
 *
 As a practical matter, exact analytic solutions for polynomial equations are often unnecessary, and so numerical methods such as Laguerre's method or the Jenkins-Traub method are probably the best way of obtaining solutions to general quintics and higher degree polynomial equations that arise in practice. However, analytic solutions are sometimes useful for certain applications, and many mathematicians have tried to develop them.*
 $p(x)=x^5-6x+3$ is not solvable, neither are $x^5-x-1$, $x^5-4x+2$, $x^5-6x+3$, $x^7-10x^5+15x+5$  $x^5-16x+2$  Able's example was $x^5-10x+2$

 Corollary: Let f(x) be an irreducible quintic polynomial over Q with
 exactly three real roots. Then its Galois group is the symmetric group,
 and hence its roots can not be expressed by radicals.
 Galois was even able to determine when a formula exists and when it does not.  For instance, $p(x)=x^5+20x+32$ is solvable but $p(x)=x^5+6x+18$ is not.
 Solvable quintics:
 $x^5-2x^{3}+x = (x+1)^2(x-1)^2*x$
 $(x+1)(x-2)(x+2)(x-1)x  = x^5-5x^{3}+4x$
 $(x-2)(x+1)x^{3} =x^5-x^4+2x^{3}$
 $(x-2)(x+2)(x+i)(x-i)x = x^5-3x^{3}-4x$
 $(x-1)(x+1)(x+i)(x-i)x =x^5-x$

 $x^3−3x+1$ has 3 real roots and all are irrational
 $x^{3}-6x^{2}+3x-10$ has an irrational root and 2 imaginary roots


## Domain Coloring
To get around this limitation we will use a simple technique known as *domain coloring* that was developed in the 1990's. It works as follows:

* "Paint" the w plane, either by copying a picture of something onto it, or by using some formula to determine the color of each point.
* Color every point z in the domain of f with the color of the corresponding point w = f ( z ).

The resulting colored picture in the z plane is the "graph" of the function f. This method is obviously very well suited for computer graphics

We can now tell a lot of information about a polynomial from a quick glance at its graph.

 * Sign of leading coefficient:  by looking at the ends
 * Minimum degree:  count # of turns and add 1
 * Real zeros and their multiplicities by looking at the way it touches or crosses the x-intercepts
 * Number of imaginary zeros:  subtracting # real from degree

 In the next section we will use this information to explore a technique for completely factoring a polynomial.


 ### Real Zeros Example 2
 The second tool that is often helpful is synthetic division.  Consider, for instance the polynomial $p(x)=\color{blue}{12}x^3-8x^2-29x+\color{red}{15}$.  The list of possible rational zeros is huge.

 $$\pm \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{1}}, \thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{1}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{5}}{\color{blue}{1}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{15}}{\color{blue}{1}} $$

 $$\frac{\color{red}{-5}}{\color{blue}{3}}, \thinspace \frac{\color{red}{-3}}{\color{blue}{2}}, \thinspace \frac{\color{red}{-5}}{\color{blue}{4}}$$

 $$\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{6}}, \thinspace \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{4}}, \thinspace \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}, \thinspace \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{2}}, \thinspace \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{4}}, \thinspace \frac{\color{red}{5}}{\color{blue}{6}}$$

 $$\frac{\color{red}{5}}{\color{blue}{4}}, \thinspace \frac{\color{red}{5}}{\color{blue}{3}}, \thinspace \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{2}}$$

 Earlier we plugged the values into the polynomial to check each one.  While that always works, synthetic division can also be used.  To show how this works we'll pick $\frac{\color{red}{-3}}{\color{blue}{2}}$ out of our list and do synthetic division.

 Since the remainder is $0$ we know that $\left(x-\frac{\color{red}{-3}}{\color{blue}{2}}\right)$ is a factor of the polynomial, which also means that $\frac{\color{red}{-3}}{\color{blue}{2}}$ is a zero.

 Anytime we do synthetic division and end with a remainder of $0$ then we have found a zero of the polynomial.

 Additionally, any other real zeros must be inside the quotient $12x^2-26x+10$ and could be found by the quadratic formula.


 ### Real Zeros Example 2
 The second tool that is often helpful is synthetic division.  Consider, for instance the polynomial $p(x)=\color{blue}{6}x^3-7x^2-16x+\color{red}{12}$.  The list of possible rational zeros is huge.

 $$\pm \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{1}}, \thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{1}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{1}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{6}}{\color{blue}{1}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{6}}{\color{blue}{1}} $$

 $$\pm \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{2}}, \thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{2}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{2}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{6}}{\color{blue}{2}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{6}}{\color{blue}{2}} $$

 $$\pm \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}, \thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{3}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{3}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{6}}{\color{blue}{3}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{6}}{\color{blue}{3}} $$

 $$\pm \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{6}}, \thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{6}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{6}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{6}}{\color{blue}{6}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{6}}{\color{blue}{6}} $$

 By eliminating duplicate values like $\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{1}}$ and $\frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{2}}$ and looking at the graph

## Synthetic Division Template

\[
\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.5}
\setlength\doublerulesep{0pt}
\begin{array}{rrrrr}
\multicolumn{1}{r|}{\frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{3}}} & 3 & -14 & 23 & -10\\\cline{2-5}
 & & 2 & -8 & 10\\\cline{2-5}
 & 3 & -12 & 15 & 0

If more than two of the zeroes are not rational then this process will not find all of the zeroes.

 ## MODELING ADVANTAGES
 from http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmd/section8/pmd812.htm

 1. Rational function models can take on an extremely wide range of shapes, accommodating a much wider range of shapes than does the polynomial family.
 1. Rational function models have better interpolatory properties than polynomial models.
 1. Rational functions are typically smoother and less oscillatory than polynomial models.
 1. Rational functions have excellent extrapolatory powers.
 1. Rational functions can typically be tailored to model the function not only within the domain of the data, but also so as to be in agreement with theoretical/asymptotic behavior outside the domain of interest.

 In mathematics a Padé approximant is the "best" approximation of a function by a rational function of given order.  Ferdinand Georg Frobenius was the first to introduce the notion of rational approximations of functions (nowadays known as Padé approximants).
