## 4.1.1-Notes
* need examples of working with values in a table, followed by quick check.
* need examples of working with the domain issue, and a quick check.  Maybe include a table with domain.
* need examples of working with the equations, followed by quick check.

## 4.1.4-Notes
two different topics here:  (1) finding f+g if f and g are defined by graphs and (2) graphing f+g.  need to be clear what is going on.

the graph of f+g can be obtained from the graphs of f and g by adding corresponding y-coordinates.
if you have two functions entered as equations y1 and y2, you can graph their sum by putting y1+y2 in y3

rephrased

## 4.1.5-Notes
last sentence is a bit awkward.

## 4.1.6-Notes
Focus on finding equation and evaluating first.  Then go to domain, using graph and table as examples.  Could also use more evaluating with equations, ie. what is the value of (f+g)(6), etc.
Maybe show a numerical example where, for example, (f+g)(-3) cannot be computed.  That might be an easier transition into further discussion of the domain.


## 4.1.12-Notes
Should we discuss the larger function dominating the smaller one?  Maybe using an interactive figure that shows $f+g$ somewhat trapped between the two.

It might be difficult because we would need to discuss the *magnitude* of one being larger than the other.  Might be best to leave it alone, even if it would make a cool interactive figure:

## 4.1.18-Notes
explain term, coefficient, degree
do a diagram for term and coefficient, might not need diagram for degree since that is easier to see.Each part of the polynomial that is added or subtracted is called a term of the polynomial. The example above is a polynomial with four terms.

The numbers appearing in each term in front of the variable are called the coefficients. The number appearing all by itself without a variable is called a constant.

In this case, the coefficient of x^{3} is 4, the coefficient of x^{2} is 2, the coefficient of x is -3 and the constant is 1.

Often, we arrange the terms in a polynomial so that the term with the highest degree is first and it is followed by the other terms in order of decreasing power. This is called standard form.
The following polynomials are in standard form.

4x^4 - 3x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x + 1
a^4 b^{3} - 2a^{3} b^{3} + 3a^4 b - 5ab^2 + 2

The first term of a polynomial in standard form is called the leading term and the coefficient of the leading term is called the leading coefficient.

## 4.1.19-Notes
*A quick search of "polynomials are important" in google finds :

http://nostalgia.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial.

Polynomials are important because they are the simplest functions: their definition involves only addition and multiplication (since the powers are just shorthands for repeated multiplications). They are also simple in a different sense: the polynomials of degree d n are precisely those functions whose (n+1)st derivative is identical zero. One can view calculus as the project of analyzing complicated functions by means of approximating them with polynomials. The culmination of these efforts is Taylors theorem, which roughly states that every differentiable function locally looks like a polynomial, and the Weierstrass approximation theorem, which states that every continuous function defined on a compact interval of the real axis can be approximated on the whole interval as closely as desired by a polynomial.*

http://www.onemathematicalcat.org/Math/Algebra_II_obj/polynomials.htm

*Polynomials define simple curves in the language of mathematics so that they may be easily analyzed and modified. Simple curves can be combined to closely approximate more complicated curves. Planets, weather, etc. move in curves. Mechanical forces, chemical and biological processes, etc. are not constant but change over space and time. These changes and other changes like fluctuations in the economy can be approximated by curves. Also, televisions, computers, phones, music players, etc. all receive signals that are sine waves (curves). Does an electrical engineer factor polynomials on a daily basis? No. A novelist doesn't analyze the structure of each sentence, but at some point the novelist needed to learn sentence structure to write books. In the same way, polynomials are the building blocks of all these sciences.*

The MULTIPLICATION in Geogebra needs ARROWS

To understand the behavior of a rational function, it is sometimes necssary to rewrite its equation by perform the division and simplifying, when possible.

Consider the rational function $f(x)=(x^{2}+x)/x$.  We will study the behavior of rational functions in chapter 5.

rational function can simplify to a polynomial with a modified domain.
to understand the behavior of rational function it is sometimes necessary to perform the division.  this is done by a process called polynomial long division.


## 4.3.3-Notes
adjust transparancy and drop shadows.
can we adapt this diagram to a real example with functions and values?  might be good to try at least one.



## 4.3.4-Notes
maybe skip the table.  go to examples with equations.  show that order is important.  discuss domain.   compose equations not just values

We can build up complicated functions from simple functions by using the process of composition, where the output of one function becomes the input of another. It is also sometimes necessary to carry out the reverse process, decomposing a complicated function into two or more simple
functions.


## 4.3.8-Notes
do another example or two
include a table example that brings up the Hawaii issue.  would work better if there were two tables rather than one big table.
composition examples?   graphs & real life examples


## 4.3.13-Notes
need to work this in somewhere:  *domain of f \circ g is a subset of the domain of g*
In general g \circ f(x) is not equal to f \circ g(x)

Some pairs of functions cannot be composed. Some pairs of functions can be composed only for certain values of x.
The domain of a composed function is either the same as the domain of the first function, or else lies inside it.

The range of a composed function is either the same as the range of the second function, or else lies inside it.

do one or two more composition with equation.  then graphing then business  Then wrap up by hinting inverses.

still need to do a bit of graphing, maybe use gaussian bell curve as an application.  then tie back into buisness example from addition section.

## 4.3.14-Notes
fun graphs:  
f(x)=3x-x^{3}   g(x)=x^{3}-3
f(x)=2x^{3}-x^5  g(x)=x^5-2x^{3}
f(x)=e^x  g(x)=2x^{2}-x^4
f(x)=e^x  g(x)=-2xï¿½ + 3xt - xv
f(x)=e^x  g(x)=3x-x^{3}

Here's an algorithm for constructing the graph of the composite function given the graphs of the other two http://archives.math.utk.edu/visual.calculus/0/compositions.6/index.html

similar thing from Wolfram demonstrations:

## 4.3.16-Notes
Gaussian:  $f(x)=ae^{(-(x-b)^2)/(2c^2)}$
this give standard normal
$f(x)=1/\sqrt{2 \pi} e^{-x}$
$g(x)=(x^{2})/2$



## 4.4.1-Notes

### Inverse Example, not 1:1
Take, for instance, $f(x)=\sqrt{x-4}$.  The steps below outline the complete process for finding the equation for $f^{-1}$.

\[
\begin{align}
f(x) &= \sqrt{x-4} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Original equation}} \newline
y &= \sqrt{x-4} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Replace $f(x)$ with $y$}} \newline
x &= \sqrt{y-4} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Switch $x$ and $y$}} \newline
x^2 &= y-4 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Square both sides}} \newline
x^2+4 &= y && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Add $4$}} \newline
f^{-1}(x) &= x^2+4 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$}}
\end{align}
\]

Notice that $f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x^2+4}{3}$ is *not* a one-to-one function unless we restrict its domain.  The range of $f(x)=\sqrt{x+4}$ is $y \geq 0$, so we must restrict the domain of $f^{-1}$ to $x \geq 0$.  

Whenever the equation for $f^{-1}$ is not one-to-one, as it was in this example, we need to look closely at the range of $f$, since that will determine the domain of $f^{-1}$.


## 4.4.6-Notes
To find the inverse of $f(x)=(x^{3}+1)/5$ using the switch-and-solve method, we first rewrite the function as the equation $y=(x^{3}+1)/5$, with $y$ in place of $f(x)$.  Then we interchange $x$ and $y$ to get
$x=(y^{3}+1)/5$.
The next step is to solve this equation for $y$.

| $5x = y^{3}+1$ | *Multiply both sides by $5$.* |
| --- | --- |
| $5x-1 = y^{3}$ | *Subtract $1$ from both sides.* |
| $\sqrt[3]{5x-1} = y$ | *Take the cube root.* |

Lastly we rewrite this equation using inverse function notation.

$$f^{-1}(x)=\sqrt[3]{5x-1}$$

Notice that this is the same answer we obtained earlier with the shoes-and-socks method, and that the steps needed to solve for $y$ are exactly the steps listed in the shoes-and-socks method.
