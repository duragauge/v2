* Also discuss realistic domains & ranges


## Power Laws
**There doesn't seem to be a good place to include this.  The examples are not of this type.**
You may have noticed that frequently occurring things are often much smaller than things which occur rarely. For example, small diamonds are common but large diamonds like the 45.52 carat Hope Diamond are extremely rare. The craters of the Moon have a similar pattern.  There are very few large craters but millions of small ones.




### Exponential Functions (extra example from 6.2)
Suppose we are asked to find a standard exponential function that passes through $(2, 4)$ and $(6, 10)$.  You'll recall that each point has an $x$ and a $y=f(x)$ coordinate.  For instance, the point $(2, 4)$ tells us that $x=2$ and $f(x)=4$ while the point $(6, 10)$ means $x=6$ and $f(x)=10$.  

 By inserting those values for $x$ and $f(x)$ into the standard exponential form $f(x)=a \thinspace b^{x}$ we create a system of two equations.   

 $$4=a  \thinspace  b^2 \text{ and } 10=a \thinspace b^6$$

 Since neither equation is equal to $0$ we can form their ratio, eliminate $a$, and find $b$.  Once $b$ is known, we can substitute it into one of these equations to find $a$.  

 We start by forming a ratio of $4=a \thinspace b^2$ and $10=a \thinspace b^6$.

\[
\begin{align}
\frac{10}{4} &= \frac{a \thinspace b^{6}}{a \thinspace b^{2}} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Form a ratio of the two equations.}} \\newline
\frac{5}{2} &= \frac{b^{6}}{b^{2}} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Cancel $a$.}} \\newline
\frac{5}{2} &= b^{4} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Simplify the powers of $b$.}} \\newline
b &= \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{1/4} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Apply the $1/4$ power to both sides.}} \\newline
b &\approx 1.26 && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{calulator approximation.}}
\end{align}
\]
 Now that we have a value for $b$, we substitute it into either of the initial equations to find $a$.

\[
\begin{align}
4 &=  a\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{1/2} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Use the exponent rule $(x^n)^{m}=x^{nm}$.}} \\newline 
a &=  4\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{-1/2} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by $\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{1/2}$.}} \\newline
a &\approx 2.53 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Decimal approximation.}}
\end{align}
\]

 Thus, the exponential function that passes through the points $(2,4)$ and $(6,10)$ is $f(x)=2.53(1.26)^{x}$.

### Population Growth
![](/img/chapter-3/petri_dishes.png#center)

A common experiment in college biology labs is to incubate bakers' yeast in a petri dish filled with a nutrient-rich solution.  As the yeast grows groups of cells, called colonies, begin to appear as small white balls.

Suppose you initially see $3$ yeast colonies.  You come back $24$ hours later the number of colonies has jumped to $87$.

To find a continuous growth function $f(t)=a \thinspace e^{k  t}$ that models the number of yeast colonies we must first use the given data to find the continuous growth rate $k$.  

{{% check %}}
1. Using $a=3$, $t=24$ and $f(t)=87$ find the equation we must solve to find $k$.  You do not need to solve the equation.
{{% answer %}}We need to solve the equation $87=3 e^{k \thinspace 24}$ for $k$.{{% /answer %}}
{{% /check %}}

To solve $87=3 e^{k(24)}$ for $k$, we proceed as follows:
\[\begin{align}
87 & =3 e^{k(24)} \\newline
\frac{87}{3} &=  e^{24  k} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by $3$ to isolate the exponential.}} \\newline
\ln\left(\frac{87}{3}\right) &=  \ln\left(e^{24  k}\right) && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Apply the natural log $\ln$ to both sides.}} \\newline
\ln\left(\frac{87}{3}\right) &=  24 k && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Use the inverse relationship $\ln\left(e^{x}\right)=x$}} \\newline
\frac{\ln\left(\frac{87}{3}\right)}{24} &= k && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by $24$.}} \\newline
k  &\approx  0.140 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Decimal approximation.}} \end{align}
\]

We now know that the yeast are growing at a continuous rate of 14%, and that the function modeling their growth is

\[
  f(t)=3 e^{0.14 t}
\]

models the number of yeast colonies $t$ hours after the experiment began.

{{% check %}}
1. We were told that there were 87 yeast colonies after 24 hours.  According to this model, how many will there be after 48 hours? {{% answer %}}$f(48)=3 e^{0.14(48)}\approx2486${{% /answer %}}
1. In this example, the yeast were growing at a continuous rate of $k=0.14$, or 14%.  Use the fact that $b=e^{k}$ to convert the function $f(t)=3 e^{0.14 t}$ into the standard form $f(x)=a \thinspace b^{x}$.  Then identify the growth factor and growth rate. {{% answer %}}Since $b=e^0.14\approx1.15$ the growth factor is $1.15$ and the growth rate is $r=0.15$, meaning the yeast grow 15% per hour.  The function $f(x)=3(1.15)^{x}$ is the standard form of the continuous growth function $f(t)=3 e^{0.14 t}$.{{% /answer %}}

-------------------------------------
## Example: Wheeler County, Oregon (from 6.3)
When provided with data, it is often possible to use a built in regression program to find the equation of a function that fits the data.

{{% imgcap file="/img/chapter-3/39664780224_6dd2c482f6_b.jpg" title="Photo by Jim Choate on Flickr" source="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimchoate/39664780224/" %}}

For instance, in 1970 the total population of Wheeler county in central Oregon was just 1849 people. By 1990, that number had dropped to 1396 people. Assuming that the population decays exponentially, we can use an exponential regression program like `ExpReg` to find an exponential model for the given data.  

The steps for doing this will vary depending on the calculator used.  You will want to become familiar with the instructions for your calculator.  The basic process should be similar to the steps you used in previous chapters for  `LinReg` , `QuadReg`  and `PwrReg`.

Since the initial population given is from 1970, it makes sense let our variable $x$ be years since 1970.  After entering the data and running `ExpReg`

![](/img/chapter-3/expreg_1.png#center)

we see that the population of Wheeler county Oregon can be modeled by the function $f(x)=1849(0.986)^{x}$, where $x$ is years since 1970.  

{{% check %}}
1.  Using this model, interpolate the population for 1980.  How does this prediction match the actual US Census value of 1513 people?  {{% answer %}}Since 1980 is in between our two data points, we expect that interpolating the value for 1980 should be reasonably close.  With $x = 10$ we get
\[f(10) = 1849(0.986)^{10 \approx = 1606\] which isn't too far off the actual US Census value of 1513.{{% /answer %}}
{{% /check %}}

Let's use our model $f(x) = 1849(0.986)^{x}$, where $x$ is years since 1970, to predict the population of Wheeler county in 2010.  Using $x = 40$ we have

\[
  f(40) = 1849(0.986)^{40} \approx 1052
\]

meaning that our model predicts that the population should have been 1052 people in 2010.  But according to the US Census, Wheeler county actually had 1441 residents in 2010!

Inaccuracies like this are a risk any time we extrapolate our results far into the future, especially if the model is built on limited data.  A more reasonable approach would be to gather all of the available census data and then make a model.  The data and scatterplot below includes US Census data from 1970 through 2010.

![](/img/chapter-3/wheeler_scatterplot.png#center)

It's not clear from the scatterplot that an exponential function would match the shape of the data.  What we seem to need is a function that can go down and up and then down again.  In Chapters 4 and 5 we'll discover polynomial functions which increase and decrease any number of times.  

Even though polynomials will eventually let us find a function that fits this data exactly, it still may not be a good predictor of the future.  This uncertainty is one of the difficulties in modeling real life situations. 


## Book Sales (from 6.3)
In the previous examples, the independent variables were well defined.  However, it is sometimes possible to work with data even if there is no obvious independent variable.  In such cases, it is common to sort the data from largest to smallest and use the rank as the x-value.  For instance, $x=1$ corresponds to the largest value, $x=2$ corresponds to the second largest value, and so on.

One place to find ranked data is in a best-selling book list.  This table shows some of the best-selling books in the United Kingdom from 1998 though the end of 2011.

![](/img/chapter-2/Top_books_UK.svg#center)

Since the values decrease, if a trend exists it will resemble a decreasing power function, one where the power is negative.  

{{% geogebra ratio="33.33%" id_1="suD06NFpAVH7oCiU" id_2="Wps11VWC" id_m="Wps11VWC" %}}
</br>
A scatterplot of the book data shows a pattern that appears to match the shape of a power function with $p \lt 1$.  Using a power regression program, we find the power function that fits this data best is

\[
  f(x)=5408784.21 x^{-0.46}
\]

Eric Carle's children's book *The Very Hungry Catepillar* is ranked 54th on the list.  According to our model, the number of copies sold should be

\[
  f(54) = 5408784.21(54)^{-0.46}\approx 863373
\]

which is fairly close to the 855,920 actually sold.

{{% check %}}
Use the function above to estimate the ranking of John Grisham's book *The Summons*, which sold 677,378 copies, by solving for $x$ when $f(x)=677378$. {{% answer %}}

\[
  \begin{align}
    677378 &=  5 408 784.21 x^{-0.46} && \text{Set up the equation.} \newline
    0.1252366 &= x^{-0.46} && \text{Divide both sides by 5408784.21.} \newline
    91 &\approx x && \text{Apply the } 1/-0.46 \text{ power to both sides.}
  \end{align}
\]

*The Summons* actually ranked number 84 which is reasonably close to our approximation.

Solving a system is not always possible and there is an entire field of mathematics, linear algebra, devoted to studying systems and their solutions.

We won't be able to explore the depths of linear algebra but, generally speaking, the number of equations in a system should match the number of unknown values for there to be a chance of solving the system.  To solve for $6$ values, for instance, you typically need $6$ equations.

The number of unknown values in many applications is often huge.  If you view the color of a single pixel on a screen as a single unknown value, then it's easy to see why there might be hundreds and thousands of equations involved in solving a single system.

The system we will work with will only have a few unknown values, but the basic solving techniques are used on systems of all sizes.

substitution, elimination, and using technology

There is even an entire branch of mathematics devoted to studying systems and their solutions, so the subject is much deeper than what we can cover here.


### Substitution Example 2 - Find Power Function Given 2 Points
$f(x)=k \thinspace x^{p}$

$(2, 5)$
$(6,10)$

$5=k \thinspace 2^{p}$
$10=k \thinspace 6^{p}$

\[
\begin{align}
\frac{5}{10} &= \frac{k \thinspace 2^{p}}{k \thinspace 6^{p}} \newline
\frac{1}{2} &= \frac{2^{p}}{6^{p}} \newline
\frac{5}{10} &= \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^{p} \newline
\frac{5}{10} &= \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{p} \newline
\ln \left(\frac{5}{10}\right) &= \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{p} \newline
\ln \left(\frac{5}{10}\right) &= p  \thinspace  \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \newline
p &= \frac{\ln \left(\frac{5}{10}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}
\end{align}
\]

## Solve Systems of Linear Equations with Technology
The most efficient way to represent a system do Gauss-Jordan elimination is to convert a system into a matrix and input that matrix into a calculator.

### Splines?

In computer graphics not only do you need to connect two points, but you need that segment to join smoothly with other segments.  So the equation for one section should depend in part on the sections next to it.

## Circle Through 3 Points

Nope, no can do at this level.  This requires using determinants.

## Cubic Through 4 Points
$$f(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=y$$
In these equations the values of x’s and y’s are assumed to be known, so we can view this as a linear system in the unknowns a0, a1, . . . , an−1.

## Introduction
When shopping for cookie ingredients at a grocery store it makes no difference if you grab eggs or flour first.  As long as you get everything on your list you'll be fine.

But when following the recipe, the order of each step is important. If instead of creaming the butter with the sugar you accidentally mix it with flour first, the cookies won't turn out right.

In mathematics, **sequences** are like recipes in that order is important.

## Recursive Sequences

When we plot sequences we do not end up with a nice, continuous curve.  Instead we get a bunch of dots.

1. Discuss the differences between the function $f(x)=2x+3$ and the sequence $a_{n}=2n+3$

Decide if the sequence $-4, -1, 2, 5, 8, \dots$  is arithmetic or geometric.  Then give it's formula.

Decide if the sequence $1, -3, 9, -27, 81, -243, \dots$  is arithmetic or geometric.  Then give it's formula.

Decide if the sequence $5, 2, -2, -6, -11 , \dots$  is arithmetic or geometric.  Then give it's formula.


13.	Suppose a house, originally purchased in 1963 for $12,000, increases in value 10% per year.  
	(a)	Write a sequence which describes the value of the home.  

	(b)	What is that house worth today?

	(c)	Will this sequence be finite or infinite?

14.	Suppose you bought a $1500 computer in 2004 and that its value is dropping by $450 dollars per year.  
	(a)	Write a sequence describing the value of the computer.  

	(b)	What is the computer worth today?

While Gauss figured this formula out on his own, it had been known for several hundred years at the time since Fibonacci published it in 1202.  

Problem 3 :
If a clock strikes once at 1'o clock,twice at 2'o clock and so on.How many times will it strike a day?

Solution :

The clock strikes once at 1'o clock,twice at 2'o clock and so on.Now we have to write this pattern as series because we need to find number of times that the clock strike a day.

  = 2 [1 + 2 + 3 + ............ + 12]
  = 2 x (n/2) [a+L]
  = 2 x (12/2) [1+12]
  = 12 [13]
  = 156

Therefore the clock will strike 156 times in a day.

Series written in summation notation can still be evaluated using the formulas we developed earlier.

The connection between the two is that $S_n$
$$\Large S_n \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k$$

1. Evaluate $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}4(0.5)^{n−1}$.
1. Evaluate $\sum_{n=1}^{20} 6 − 2(n − 1)$.
