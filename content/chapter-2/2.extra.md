## How Power Functions Change
The last place we should look for patterns is in the way power functions change.  In Chapter 1 we saw that when input values are equally spaced, patterns can sometimes emerge in the differences between successive outputs.  For instance, let's look at some values of the power function $f(x) = x = x^1$ and the differences between them.

![](/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_x.svg#center)

Notice that these first differences are constant.  If we repeat the process with the power function $f(x) = x^{2}$, it becomes apparent that the second differences are constant.

![](/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_2.svg#center)

Since the first differences of $f(x)=x^1$ are constant and the second differences of $f(x)=x^{2}$, it would be reasonable to assume that the *third* differences of $f(x)=x^3$ are constant.  This is, indeed, the case.

![](/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_3.svg#center)

In general, if  $n$ is a positive integer, then the $n$-th differences of $f(x) = x^{n}$ will be constant.

Patterns can also be found by looking at the percent change of a function.  Recall that percent change is given by

$$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{f(a)}$$

The tables below show the percent change of  the power functions $f(x)=x^1$, $f(x)=x^{2}$, and $f(x)=x^3$

![](/img/chapter-1/percent_change_identity.png#center)

![](/img/chapter-1/percent_change_square.png#center)

![](/img/chapter-1/percent_change_cube.png#center)

In each case the percent increase is shrinking.  In other words, as $x$ gets larger, the increase in $f(x)$ is a smaller and smaller percent of the value of the function. As an illustration, the United States' national debt grew by $\$430,000,000,000$ over the first quarter of 2010.  That's a lot of money, but it was only a percent increase of $0.034$, or $3.4\%$, which doesn't sound nearly as large. The percent change of any power function will always shrink toward $0$ as $x$ gets larger and larger.



## 2.2.2  Evaluate Power Functions
When evaluating power functions by hand, you can often take advantage of the rules of exponents to simplify the work, especially if the power is a rational number.  Of particular note is the following rule:

$$x^{n/m} =  \left(x^{1/m}\right)^{n}$$

Suppose $f(x) =  x^{2/3}$ and you need to evaluate $f(8)$.  The rule above allows you to break this evaluation into two simpler steps.

$$8^{2/3} =  \left(8^{1/3}\right)^2$$

Recalling that the $1/3$ power is the cube root, it becomes clear that $8^{1/3}$ is equal to $2$.  Squaring $2$ gives the answer $f(8)=4$.

## 2.2.3 Evaluate Power Functions
On some occasions you may want to use a calculator to evaluate power functions.  When doing so you must be careful to wrap $x$ and/or $p$ in parenthesis whenever each is anything other than a whole number. For example, if $f(x)=x^{2/5}$ and you need to evaluate $f(-3/8)$, then you should put parenthesis around both $-3/8$ and around the power $2/5$.  Without parenthesis, the normal order of operations would give a very different answer.

| **Correct evaluation of $(-3/8)^{2/5}$** | **Incorrect evaluation of $(-3/8)^{2/5}$** |
| --- | --- |
| `(-3/8)^(2/5) = 0.675480019` | `-3/8^2/5 = -0.009375` |

Even with the correct placement of parenthesis, some calculators may still give an error.  In such cases, breaking it up into two steps, like you did on the prior page, will usually do the trick.

| **Alternate evaluation of $(-3/8)^{2/5}$** |
| --- |
| `( (3/8)^(1/5) )^2  = 0.675480019` |

Lastly, keep in mind that if $m$ is even, then $x^{1/m}$ is not a real number when $x<0$.  Additionally, $0^n$ is undefined if $n\leq0$.  Expressions involving either of these will produce an error message on your calculator.

## 2.2.4  Evaluate Power Functions
The same use of parenthesis will be needed when entering power functions with rational powers into your calculator's graphing menu.  To graph $f(x)=x^{2/3}$ for example, parenthesis should be included around the $2/3$.

| **Correct syntax and graph of $f(x)=x^{3/2}$** | **Incorrect syntax and graph of $f(x)=x^{3/2}$** |
| --- | --- |

| ![](/img/chapter-2/power_graphing_2b.png) | ![](/img/chapter-2/power_graphing_1b.png) |

It is very likely that you could create a graph of this function by hand, using the techniques covered in , in less time than it would take to use a graphing calculator.  However, both skills are necessary and you should not use one to the exclusion of the other.

### Acceleration of Electric Car

Acceleration of a vehicle represents an increase in its kinetic energy. During acceleration, electrical energy from the battery is converted, via the electric motor, into the kinetic energy possessed by the vehicle. The formula for kinetic energy is ½ MV^2, where M = mass and V = velocity. The mass remains the same, but the velocity increases with acceleration, and the kinetic energy increases by the square of the velocity. So, to reach 8 mph requires four times the energy it takes to reach 4 mph, not just double.

If you want to work it out, 8×8=64, and 4X4= 16, and 4X16=64.

This is why the faster your car is going, the harder it is to stop. However, time does not come into it, so that to increase speed to 60 mph in one second takes the same amount of energy as it would to increase speed to 60 mph in 1 min. It just needs a much more powerful motor to deliver all that energy within such a short length of time.

The Engineering
The science seems to indicate that how quickly a car accelerates should not make any difference to energy consumption.

## Stopping time
Under constant deceleration ($a<0$) the time to come to a complete stop from a speed $v$ is $t=\frac{-v}{a}$

Given the time to come to a complete stop under constant deceleration ($a<0)$ from a speed $v$ is $x=vt+\frac{1}{2}t^2$

## Kinematics

## Volume of a Sphere
Let's look at another example where creating a formula makes sense.  The volume of a sphere is a function of the length of the radius and is given by

$$V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$$

Solving for $r$ would give us a formula that computes the radius based on the volume.

<div>
$$\begin{aligned}
V &=   \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3} \\
\frac{3}{4} V &=   \pi r^{3} && \text{Multiply both sides by 3/4} \\
\frac{3}{4 \pi} V &=  r^{3} && \text{Divide both sides by } \pi \\
r &=   \left(\frac{3}{4 \pi}V\right)^{1/3} && \text{Apply the 1/3 power to both sides} \\
\end{aligned}$$

## Use Transformations to Fit Power Functions to Data
In our early data sets, such as the number of iPads sold, the data naturally included the origin, even though we did not insert $(0,\ 0)$ as a data point.  This was fortunate, as the `PwrReg` program automatically assumes that $(0, 0)$ is part of the data. When the data shows an increasing trend, but it does not naturally go through the origin, it may be necessary to manipulate the data before running the regression.  

![](/img/chapter-2/motorcycle_fatalities.png#center)

Manipulating data can be a tricky proposition, and we will explore several possibilities in this next example until we find one that works.

![](/img/chapter-2/motorcycle_shift_1.png#center)

A scatterplot of data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety clearly shows that the percent of fatally injured motorcyclists aged 50 and older has been increasing since 1980. In addition, the trend looks visually similar to a power function model with $p>1$.  However, running `PwrReg` with the given data produces an `overflow error`.

![](/img/chapter-2/overflow.png#center)  

A common way to get around an overflow error is to align the $x$ values by subtracting the same number from each one.  For instance, rather than using the actual year, we might use years *since* 1980 by subtracting 1980 from each year.The resulting scatterplot has the same exact shape, the only difference being that it is located 1980 spaces to the left of the original data.

![](/img/chapter-2/motorcycle_shift_2.png#center)

Unfortunately, running `PwrReg` with this data produces a domain error

![](/img/chapter-2/domain_error.png#center).

Since `PwrReg` always assumes $(0,\ 0)$ is a data point, we cannot use $0$ as a value in any other data point.  Our data point $(0,\ 3)$ is the culprit here.

So where do we go now?  We need to shift the data to avoid an overflow error, but if we shift it to $0$ then we run into a domain error. One option would be to use years since 1900, so that 1980 would be $x=80$, 1985 would be $x=85$, and so on.

![](/img/chapter-2/motorcycle_shift_3.png#center)

Making this shift produces a power function that fits the data very well.  It does, however, have one drawback.  The value of the scaling factor is $2.040725*10^{-15}$ or $0.000\ 000\ 000\ 000\ 002\ 040\ 725$, which is an awkward number to work with.

To make the parameters in the function easier to deal with, let's try shifting the x-values so that they represents years since 1979.  So 1980 would become $x=1$,  1985 turns into $x=6$, and so on.  The results of running `PwrReg` on this data are shown below.

![](/img/chapter-2/motorcycle_shift_4.png#center)

While the values are smaller, this power function model still has problems.

{{% check %}}
What's wrong with this power function model?    {{% answer %}}The shape of the model does NOT fit the shape of the data.  While the data appear to have the concave up shape of a power function with $p>1$, the equation for the model clearly has a power between $0$ and $1$ which has a concave down shape.{{% /answer %}}
{{% /check %}}

![](/img/chapter-2/motorcycle_fatalities_shifted.png#center)

We have now tried three different ways of shifting the x-values, and none have resulted in a satisfactory model.  We need to rethink our strategy.  The source of our problem lies in the fact that the `PwrReg` regression program automatically inserts the origin $(0, 0)$ as part of the data set.  The trick is to use that to our advantage. Rather than just shifting the x-values, our recommended approach is to shift *both* the x and y values so that the initial data point becomes $(0, 0)$.  Then we will run `PwrReg`, leaving out the point $(0, 0)$.  Finally, we use transformations to shift the function back to the location of the original data.  To apply this approach to the motorcycle data, we begin by subtracting 1980 from all the x-values and subtracting 3 from all of the y-values.

Running `PwrReg` on the transformed motorcycle data yields $y=0.038x^1.94$

![](/img/chapter-2/motorcycle_shift_5.png#center)

To get our final equation we shift the equation 1980 spaces to the left and 3 spaces up.  The resulting function is $f(x)=0.038(x-1980)^1.94 + 3$.

![](/img/chapter-2/motorcycle_shift_6.png#center)

While not a pure power function, it fits the original data nicely and allows us to use the actual year as the variable.

In summary, if the data does not naturally include the origin, consider using the following procedure.

1. Adjust the data so that the first point $(x_1, y_1)$ is shifted to the origin.  Do this by subtracting $x_1$ from every x-value and subtracting $y_1$ from every y-value.  Then remove the point $(0, 0)$ from the data set.
1. Use the `PwrReg` program on the shifted data to find a power function of the form $f(x)=a*x^{p}$.  
1. Shift the function back to the location of the original data.  The final model will be of the form $f(x) =  a(x - x_{1})^{p} + y_1$.
This process of repositioning the origin may sound complicated, but in practice it is reasonably quick, and extremely useful.

## iPad Sales
In early 2010, Steve Jobs introduced the world to a revolutionary new device: Apple's iPad.  The iPad went on sale at the start of April, 2010 and has become a huge success.  The table below shows the total number of iPads sold since its release.

![](/img/chapter-2/steve_jobs_ipad_sales.png#center)

In looking at the chart, we have to ask ourselves if it would be possible to find a function that fits the data.  If so, then we could predict future iPad sales, something Apple, and their competitors, would surely be interested in.  

The first question we should ask ourselves is what type of function would be appropriate for the data.  We do this in two ways.  First, we construct a scatter plot, look at the shape of the data, and see if it is similar to any functions we are aware of.  Second, we try to incorporate any information we know about the real life scenario we are modeling.  Doing so may eliminate some functions from contention or indicate a restricted domain.

![](/img/chapter-2/ipad_scatterplot.gif#center)

A scatter plot of the iPad data clearly shows an increasing, concave up trend, which suggests that a power function model of the form $f(x)=k x^{p}$ with $p>1$ could be a good fit.  Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that when the iPad had been on the market $0$ days, then $0$ units had been sold.  This assumption supports our choice since all increasing power functions pass through the origin.

Now that we have chosen a model, we need to find values for $k$ and $p$ that make the model fit the data as closely as possible.  It's easier said than done!  In the figure below, you are free to change both $k$ and $p$.  Try to find a pair that closely matches the shape of the iPad sales data.  Make a note of your result before continuing.

<iframe scrolling="no" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/IXZ48q10/width/680/height/340/border/888888/rc/false/ai/false/sdz/false/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ld/false/sri/false/at/preferhtml5" width="680px" height="340px" style="border:0px;"> </iframe>


In working with the figure you may have found that several combinations fit the data fairly well.  The power function that actually fits the iPad sales data best is $f(x) =  0.57 x^{1.48}$.{{% sidenote "power_reg" %}}This equation was found using the power regression routine (often called `PwrReg`) on a graphing calculator. ![](/img/chapter-2/ipad_regression.gif#center){{% /sidenote %}} When plotted along with the data, this function comes as close as possible to each data point.

![](/img/chapter-2/Power_Function_iPad_best_fit.png#center)

With this equation in hand, we are now ready to write down the model, complete with a description of the variables.

>According to data provided by Apple's quarterly financial reports,  the total number of iPads sold, in millions, can be modeled by the function
>$$f(x) =  0.57 x^{1.48}$$
>where $x$ is the number of months since April 2010, when iPad was first offered for sale.

This model could be used, for example, to predict the total number of iPads sold after 5 years.  To do so, we convert 5 years to 60 months and evaluate $f(60)$.

$$f(60) =   0.57(60)^{1.48} \approx 244$$

We conclude that this model predicts that Apple will have sold 244 million iPads over the first 5 years of sales.

Our iPad model could also be used to estimate how long it will take to reach certain sales milestones.  For instance, to find when the 500 million-th iPad will be sold, we replacing $f(x)$ with $500$ and solve for $x$.

<div>
$$\begin{aligned}
500 &=   0.57 x^{1.48} \\
877.19 &=   x^{1.48} && \text{Divide both sides by } 0.57 \\
877.19^{1/1.48} &=  x && \text{Apply the 1/1.48 power to both sides} \\
x &\approx 97.4 && \text{Approximate}
\end{aligned}$$
</div>

Thus, if iPad sales continue along the same trend, it will take approximately 97.4 months, or 8.12 years, to sell 500 million iPads.

## Allometry
You may have noticed that frequently occurring things are often much smaller than things which occur rarely. For example, small diamonds are common, but large diamonds like the 45.52 carat Hope Diamond are extremely rare. Or the world population of blue whales is much smaller than the number of house flies.

In the natural sciences, many other aspects of an organism's life are connected to its size. Life expectancy, brain size, gestational period, metabolic rate, just to name a few, depend on body mass. These connections are often called "power laws", because they involve power functions.

Allometry is the study of the relationship of body size to shape, anatomy, physiology and finally behaviour

It is the relation between the size of an organism and the size of any of its parts: for example, there is an allometric relation between brain size and body size, such that (in this case) animals with bigger bodies have bigger brains.

Good article from the journal nature:  https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/allometry-the-study-of-biological-scaling-13228439/
Allometry, in its broadest sense, describes how the characteristics of living creatures change with size.  Allometry is   the study of how these processes scale with body size
