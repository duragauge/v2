## Constructing Exponential Models
When solving real life problems, we usually will not be given the equation directly.  When this happens, we must construct it from the information available and our knowledge of appropriate models.


## Air Pressure
Consider, for example, the work of the 17th Century Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli.  Torricelli famously said, "We live submerged at the bottom of an ocean of air". The weight of this "ocean of air" is called atmospheric pressure and Torricelli developed an instrument to measured it: the barometer.

As people began to explore the atmosphere with scientific balloons they took barometers with them.  Soon they discovered that atmospheric pressure is a function of altitude and is given by

$$P(x)=14.7*e^{-0.1925 x}$$

where $x$ is the altitude in miles above sea level and $P(x)$ is the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi).  As you gain altitude the pressure drops because there is less air above you.   At sea level, $x=0$ and $P(0)=14.7$ psi.

On August 16, 1960, USAF Captain Joseph Kittinger was lifted by a helium balloon up to an altitude 19.47 miles, at which point he jumped out!  At that height, what would the air pressure reading be on his barometer?  Taking $x=19.47$ we have

$$P(19.47)=14.7*e^{-0.1925 \cdot 19.47} \approx 0.346 \text{psi}$$

This seems reasonable since at 19.47 miles above Earth there is very little air and, as a result, very little air pressure.



## 3.6.22 Other Model Examples
![](/img/chapter-3/home_construction.gif)According to the US Census and the Home Builders Association, the size of the average new home has grown from 1200 square feet in 1950 to 2225 in 1999.

![](/img/chapter-3/hard_drive.gif)At the start of the year 2000, a gigabyte of computer hard drive space cost approximately $16.45.  By the start of 2005 the cost had dropped to just $0.72.  

![](/img/chapter-3/ram.gif)At the start of the year 2000, 1 megabyte of RAM (a type of computer memory) cost approximately $2.00.  Since then the cost of 1 meg of RAM has decreased by half every 18 months.

![](/img/chapter-3/hydrogen_peroxide.gif)Suppose you start with a concentration of 23 mmoles/liter of hydrogen peroxide.  5 minutes after adding some potassium iodide the concentration has dropped to 4 mmoles/liter.  

Use this information to construct an exponential function which models the concentration t minutes after adding the potassium iodide.

What is the half-life of your model?

![](/img/chapter-3/iwo_jima.gif)During WW II the U.S. and Japan fought a terrible battle over the pacific island of Iwo Jima.  On the day of the U.S. invasion there were about 22,000 Japanese troops on the island.  Only 1038 survived the 36-day long battle.

![](/img/chapter-3/fruit_fly.gif)

Suppose you start with 3 male and 3 female Drosophila fruit flies (6 total). 	Under ideal conditions, that population can double every 2.5 days.   Use this information to find an exponential function which models the fruit fly population afterdays.
How long until you have a population of 1000 Drosophila ?

![](/img/chapter-3/bunny.gif)
Suppose your neighbor is starts a rabbit farm with 4 cute, little Holland Lop bunnies.   One hundred days later he is tending a herd of 40 rabbits.  Assuming exponential growth, how long until he has 500 rabbits?

In this next example we will find a continuous growth model, and then attempt to convert it to  half-life.

The breeding season for most rabbits lasts 9 months, from February to October. In Australia and New Zealand breeding season is late July to late January. Normal gestation is about 30 days. The average size of the litter varies but is usually between 4 and 12 babies, with larger breeds having larger litters. A kit (baby rabbit) can be weaned at about 4 to 5 weeks of age. This means in one season a single female rabbit can produce as many as 800 children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.



### Relating Bases
One technique for solving an exponential equation is to take advantage of the fact that all exponential functions are one-to-one.  This means that

$$b^N=b^M \text{ if and only if }N=M$$

So if we can express both sides of an equations as powers of the same base, the one-to-one property tells us that the solution can be found by equating the exponents.  This method is sometimes called **relating the bases**.

For example, suppose we want to solve $7^{x+3}=49$.  We can do so by writing both sides as powers of $7$ and equating the exponents.

\[
\begin{align}
7^{x+3} &= 49 \newline
7^{x+3} &= 7^2 && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{{\text{rewrite }} 49=7^2} \newline
x+3 &= 2 && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text {since exponentials are one-to-one}} \newline
x &= -1 && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{-3 \text{ from both sides}}
\end{align}
\]

Notice that this method only works when both sides can be written easily as powers of the same base.  If the equation had been just slightly different, say $7^{x+3}=50$, we would not have been able to solve it.

x &= 4  && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{+1 \text{ to both sides}}
\end{align}
\]

### Rewrite
Another useful technique is to rewrite an exponential equation as an equivalent logarithmic equation and use the change of base formula.

$$\log_b(x)=\frac{\log(x)}{\log(b)}=\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)}$$

We will demonstrate this method to solve the equation $3^{x}=10$.
\[
\begin{align}
3^{x} &= 10 \newline
x &= \log_3(10) && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{rewrite}} \newline
x &= \frac{\ln(10)}{\ln(3)} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{change of base formula}} \newline
x & \approx 2.0959 && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{evaluate}} \newline
\end{align}
\]
We could have used $\log$ in the change of base formula and still arrived at the correct answer.

x & \approx 3.292 && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{evaluate}} \newline

 ## 3.6 Find Exponential Function Given 2 Points
 Suppose we are asked to find a standard exponential function that passes through $(2, 4)$ and $(6, 10)$.  You'll recall that each point has an $x$ and a $y=f(x)$ coordinate.  For instance, the point $(2, 4)$ tells us that $x=2$ and $f(x)=4$ while the point $(6, 10)$ means $x=6$ and $f(x)=10$.  

 By inserting those values for $x$ and $f(x)$ into the standard exponential form $f(x)=a \thinspace b^{x}$ we create a system of two equations.   

 $$4=a  \thinspace  b^2 \text{ and } 10=a \thinspace b^6$$

 Since neither equation is equal to $0$ we can form their ratio, eliminate $a$, and find $b$.  Once $b$ is known, we can substitute it into one of these equations to find $a$.  

 We start by forming a ratio of $4=a \thinspace b^2$ and $10=a \thinspace b^6$.

 | $\frac{10}{4}  =  \frac{a \thinspace b^{6}}{a \thinspace b^{2}}$ | *Form a ratio of the two equations.* |
 | --- | --- |
 | $\frac{5}{2}  =  \frac{b^{6}}{b^{2}}$ | *Cancel $a$.* |
 | $\frac{5}{2}  =  b^{4}$ | *Simplify the powers of $b$.* |
 | $b  =  \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{1/4}  \approx  1.26$ | *Apply the $1/4$ power to both sides.* |

 Now that we have a value for $b$, we substitute it into either of the initial equations to find $a$.

 | $4  =  a\left[\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{1/4}\right]^{2}$ |*Substitute $b=\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{1/4}$.* |
 | --- | --- |
 | $4  =  a\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{1/2}$ |*Use the exponent rule $(x^n)^{m}=x^{n m}$.* |
 | $a  =  4\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{-1/2}  \approx  2.53$ | *Divide both sides by $\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{1/2}$.* |

 Thus, the exponential function that passes through the points $(2,4)$ and $(6,10)$ is $f(x)=2.53(1.26)^{x}$.

 {{% answer %}}Either $f(0)=2.53$ or the point $(0, 2.53)$.{{% /answer %}}
 2. Identify both the growth factor and the growth rate of $f(x)=2.53(1.26)^{x}$.
 {{% answer %}}The growth factor is the base $b=1.26$.  The growth rate is $r=b-1=0.26$, meaning that every time $x$ increases by $1$ the function increases by $26\%$.{{% /answer %}}

 ## Create Logistic Models
 Suppose you put $5$ sea monkeys in a tank and that after $30$ days the population has grown to $20$ sea monkeys.  Is there a way to predict how many sea monkeys there will be after $90$ days?

 According to official sources, a typical tank can safely hold about $100$ sea monkeys.  Any more than that and there may not be enough oxygen for all of them.  This means we are dealing with a limited growth situation and should use a logistic function of the form $f(x)=\frac{c}{1+ae^{-bx}}$ as our model.

 {{% check %}}
 1. Based on the given information, what will the carrying capacity $c$ of the logistic model be? {{% answer %}}Since are told that the habitat can only support $100$ sea monkeys, our carrying capacity is $c=100$.{{% /answer %}}
 1. Which values of the function do we know? {{% answer %}}We are also given that $f(0)=5$ and $f(30)=20$.{{% /answer %}}
 {{% /check %}}

 Our goal now is to find the parameters $a$ and $b$ in the logistic model $f(x)=\frac{c}{1+ae^{-bx}}$.  Substituting $x=0$, $f(0)=5$ and $c=100$ into the equation we find $a$ as follows:

 | $5  =  \frac{100}{1+ae^{-b(0)}}$ | |
 | --- | --- |
 | $5  =  100/(1+a)$ | *Note that $e^{-b(0)}=1$.*  |
 | $5a+5  =  100$ | *Multiply both sides by $1+a$.* |
 | $a  =  19$ | *Subtract $5$ and then divide by $5$.*  |

 With this value in hand we substitute $x=30$ and $f(30)=20$ and solve for $b$.

 | $20 =  \frac{100}{1+19e^{-b(30)}}$ | |
 | --- | --- |
 | $20(1+19e^{-b(30)})  = 100$ |*Multiply both sides by  $1+19e^{-b(30)}$.*  |
 | $1+19e^{-30 b}   =  5$ | *Divide both sides by $20$.* |
 | $19e^{-30 b}  =  4$ | *Subtract $1$ from both sides.* |
 | $b =  \frac{\ln\left(\frac{4}{19}\right)}{-30}$ | *Use the standard steps for solving an exponential equation.* |
 | $b  \approx  0.052$ | *Use a calculator to find a decimal approximation.* |

 We can now say that the logistic function

 $$f(x)=\frac{100}{1+19e^{-0.052 x}}$$

 models the sea monkey population $x$ days after having placed $5$ sea monkeys in the tank.

 1. Now that we have the logistic model, how do we determine the sea monkey population after 90 days?
 {{% answer %}}To estimate the size of the sea monkey population after 90 days, we simply need to evaluate $f(90)$.  $$f(90)=\frac{100}{1+19e^{-0.052 90}}\approx 85$$ {{% /answer %}}

 ## Create Logarithmic Models
 We now turn our attention to the task of finding a logarithmic function of the form $f(x)=a+b \ln(x)$ when given a limited set of data.  Suppose for instance, we need to find a logarithmic function through the two points $(5, 3)$ and $(20, 9)$.

 As we have done earlier, we begin by substituting the $x$ and $y=f(x)$ coordinates into the equation of our model.

 $$9 = a+b \ln(20)$$

 $$3 = a+b \ln(5)$$

 This gives a system of two equations.  In order to find $b$, we have to eliminate $a$ by subtracting one equation from the other.  

 | $9 - 3 = (a + b \ln(20)) - (a + b \ln(5))$ | |
 | --- | --- |
 | $6 = b \ln(20) - b \ln(5)$ | *Simplify.* |
 | $6 = b \ln\left(\frac{20}{5}\right)$ | *Combine using the quotient rule for logarithms.* |
 | $b = \frac{6}{\ln(4)}$ | *Divide both sides by $\ln\left(\frac{20}{5}\right)=\ln(4)$.* |
 | $b \approx 4.328$ | *Use a calculator to find a decimal approximation.* |

 Our next step will be to find $a$ using this value for $b$.

 In our task to find a logarithmic function of the form $f(x)=a+b \ln(x)$ through the two points $(5, 3)$ and $(20, 9)$, we have just determined that $b=4.328$.

 To find $a$, we substitute this value for $b$ into the equation $9=a+b \ln(20)$ and solve for $a$.

 | $9  =  a + 4.328 \ln (20)$ | |
 | --- | --- |
 | $9-4.328 \ln(20)  =  a$ | *Subtract $4.328\ln(20)$ from both sides.* |
 | $a  \approx -3.966$ | *Use a calculator to find a decimal approximation.* |

 Now that we have both $a$ and $b$, we can write out our function.  We conclude by saying that

 $$f(x) =  -3.966+4.328 \ln(x)$$

 is the logarithmic function that passes through both $(5, 3)$ and $(20, 9)$.
