## Evaluate Functions
In addition to graphing, we will often need to evaluate functions and solve related equations.  **Evaluating** a function is the process of determining the output given a particular input.  For example, in the following table $y$ is a function of $x$, or $y=f(x)$, because each $x$ is paired with a single $y$.  

| $x$ | $y=f(x)$ |
| ----- | ----- |
| $0$ | $5$ |
| $1$ | $0$ |
| $2$ | $-3$ |
| $3$ | $9$ |
| $4$ | $16$ |

To evaluate $f(3)$ we simply find the value of $y$ when $x=3$.  From the table it appears that $f(3)=9$.

Evaluating a function is different than solving an equation.  When **solving** we are given an output and must find the input.  To solve $f(x)=5$, for instance, we scan the table in the opposite direction, looking for an $x$ that creates $5$ as an output.  The solution is $x=0$.

{{% check %}}
Refer to the following table

| $x$ | $y=f(x)$ |
| ----- | ----- |
| $2$ | $7$ |
| $4$ | $-1$ |
| $6$ | $2$ |
| $8$ | $4$ |

## Does an equation represent a function
When given an equation involving $x$ and $y$, like $x^2+y^2=3$ it is not always obvious whether or not $y$ is a function of  $x$.  One technique is to try and solve the equation for $y$.  If any $x$ creates more than one $y$ then it is not a function.

When we solve $x^2+y^2=3$ for $y$ we see that

$x^2+y^2=3$
$y^2=3-x^2$ Subtract $x^2$.
$y = \pm \sqrt{3-x^2}$ Take the square root.

So for every $x$ there are two possible values for $y$.  One is $y=\sqrt{3-x^2}$ and the other is $y=-\sqrt{3-x^2}$.  This tells us that the equation $x^2+y^2=3$ does not define $y$ as a function of $x$.

Another technique for deciding if an equation is a function or not is to is to graph the equation and use the vertical line test.  For instance, the graph of  $x^2+y^2=3$ is a circle, which would not pass the vertical line test, so it does not define $y$ as a function of $x$.  

![](/img/chapter-1/graph_circle_3.png]]

This method is very useful, but we must make sure we can see the complete graph.  If we had only looked at the top half of the circle, $y=\sqrt{3-x^2}$, or only at the bottom half, $y=-\sqrt{3-x^2}$, then we might have incorrectly assumed that the equation was a function.  More will be said about finding complete graphs in the next section.


## Concavity
Another important feature of a graph is its curvature, also known as its concavity. If a graph bends up, as if to form the side of a cup, then we say it is **concave up** on that interval. If the graph bends down, like a frown, then it is **concave down**. If the graph is straight then it does not bend and does not have any concavity.

![](/img/chapter-1/concavity_details.svg#center)

Note that concavity does not tell us if a graph is increasing or decreasing.  Instead, it gives us information about how quickly, or slowly, that change is happening.  

For instance, a function that is both increasing and concave down will see its rate of growth slow down.  But the growth rate of an increasing, concave up function will speed up.  Rates of change will be studied in detail [in the next section](../1.4#rates-of-change).

## Function Notation and Units
With function notation the choice of letters is completely arbitrary. For example, if a function always adds $3$ it makes no difference whether we refer to it as $f(x)=x+3$ or as $g(x)=x+3$ or as $w(t)=t+3$. It is what a function does that matters, not what it is called.{{% marnote %}}![Saltos Red Bull en Bilbao 2015](/img/chapter-1/cliff_dive.jpg) Photo by [jamoral, on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamoral/21713225096/){{% /marnote %}}

This is especially helpful when modeling something in real life since we can choose letters that match the context.

For instance, if the height of a professional cliff diver depends on how long it has been since he leapt into the air, then we might use $h$ as the name of the height function and $t$ for the time that has elapsed. The quantity $h(t)$ would then be the height at a particular time $t$.

We should also pay attention to the units of measurement being used. If height is measured in feet and time is in seconds, then it is entirely possible that $2$ *seconds* after jumping the diver is exactly $2$ *feet* above the water and we could write $h(2)=2$. Even though the input and output are the same number, when we consider the units we realize they represent very different quantities.

## Determine Piece-wise Domain and Range from a Graph
On more complicated graphs, such as the one below, the domain and range might be the union of several intervals.

![](/img/chapter-1/graph_domain_range_b.svg#center)

In this case, the domain is  the union of the intervals $(-\infty, -2)$ and $[ 0, \infty)$, which is written as $(-\infty, -2) \bigcup [ 0, \infty)$ or, using set notation, as the set $\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace  -2<x \geq 0 \rbrace $.

The range can be described either as the union $(-\infty, 1]  \bigcup  [3, \infty)$ or as the set $\lbrace y \thinspace \vert \thinspace 1 \leq y \geq 3 \rbrace $.

## 1.4.22 Find the Inverse of a Function
In real life examples, it is often necessary to restrict the domain of the function in order to establish a one-to-one relationship.

For instance, while a person's height can be considered a function of age $H=f(A)$, it's very likely that a person's height at age 35 is the same as it was at age 25.  This height function cannot be one-to-one unless we restrict the domain to years when each height corresponds to a single age.

![](/img/chapter-1/growth_chart.png)

This graph gives the average height of a girl between birth and the age of 12.  With this restricted domain it is clear that the height function $H=f(A)$ is one-to-one, so the inverse $A=f^{-1}(H)$ must exist.  

Suppose we wanted to evaluate $f^{-1}(40)$. We can do this by reading the graph of $H=f(A)$ in reverse.  First, we locate the height $40$ on the y-axis and then find the corresponding age $4$.  Thus, $f^{-1}(40)=4$, meaning that if an average girl is 40 inches tall, we can conclude that she is 4 years old.

You might recall that this process of reading a graph backward was used in [Section 1.1](1.1.9) to solve simple equations.  Solving equations and finding inverses are very closely related, as will be illustrated in the next example.

## 1.4.23 Find the Inverse of a Function

{{% imgcap file="/img/chapter-1/LMGould.jpg" title="Photo by Bob DeValentino of the NSF" source="https://photolibrary.usap.gov/#1-1" %}}
One of the main jobs of the ship L.M. Gould  is to pick up containers of food and supplies from Punta Arenas, Chile, and deliver them to the scientists working at Palmer Station in Antarctica.

Suppose the amount of food, in pounds, that the station has on hand $D$ days after being re-supplied is given by the function $F=f(D)=11200-200D$.  The equation for $D=f^{-1}(F)$ would allow the scientists to calculate how long it has been since the ship last visited by measuring the amount of food available.

Using the shoe-socks method we first list the operations performed by the function and then invert the list.

| **Operations Performed by the Function** | **Operations Performed by the Inverse** |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1. Multiply by $-200$ | 1. Subtract $11200$ |
| 2. Add $11200$ | 2. Divide by $-200$ |

Next, start with a variable and build the equation.

| 1. Start with a variable: | $F$ |
| ----- | ----- |
| 2. Subtract $11200$: | $F-11200$ |
| 3. Divide by $-200$: | $\frac{F-11200}{-200}$ |
| 4. Write as a function: | $f^{-1}(F) = \frac{F-11200}{-200}$ |

We find that the inverse function is $D=f^{-1}(F)=\frac{F-11200}{-200}$.

If the scientists have $1000$ pounds of food left, then they know that the supply ship came $D=f^{-1}(1000) = \frac{1000-11200}{-200} = 51$ days ago.

Note that we could have also found this answer by inserting $F=1000$ into the original function and solving for $D$.  In other words, evaluating the inverse function is essentially the same as solving the original function.



## Combine Transformations
**If using this need to modify order of transformations model to $af(b(x+c))+d$ with the horizontal stretch factored out.**
Lastly, we need to examine the effects of combining transformations.  When several transformations are combined, we apply each one in order following the standard the order of operations:

**P** arentheses (which includes fraction bars)<br>
**E** xponents (which includes roots)<br>
**M** ultiplication and **D** ivision<br>
**A** ddition and **S** ubtraction.  

If several of these operations are combined, operations higher on the list should be dealt with before items lower on the list.  More details on the order of operations can be found in the Prerequisite chapter.  

If all six of the transformations were present, they would be done in the following order.

![](/img/chapter-1/multiple_transformations.svg#center)

For instance, to obtain the the graph of $y=\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^3$, we start with the graph of the cube function $f(x)=x^3$, shift it right $2$ spaces and then stretch it vertically by a factor of $1/2$.  The shifting right occurs first since the $-6$ is inside the parenthesis of the function.

Given a list points on the graph of $f(x)=x^3$, we can find points on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^3$ by first adding $2$ to each x-value, and then multiplying each y-value by $1/2$.  

![](/img/chapter-1/transformation_points_1.svg#center)

Connecting those points with a smooth curve will produce an accurate graph of $y=\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^3$.

## Slope-Intercept
Let's look at a few transformed functions that you might have seen in prior algebra classes.  To begin, we will take the identity function $f(x)=x$ and stretch it vertically by a factor of $m$ and shift it vertically $b$ units.  The result, $y=m*x+b$, is known as the **slope-intercept** form for a line, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.  The figure below will let you experiment with this equation.

<div style="text-align:center">
<iframe scrolling="no" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/hBQsE4O1/width/620/height/310/border/888888/rc/false/ai/false/sdz/false/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ld/false/sri/false/at/auto" width="620px" height="310px" style="border:0px;"> </iframe></div>


## Point-Slope
Another transformed version of the identity function is $y=m(x-x_1)+y_1$.  Which transformations have been applied?  There is a shift right $x_1$ spaces, a vertical stretch by $m$, and a vertical shift $y_1$ spaces.  The result is a line that passes through the point $(x_1, y_1)$ and has a slope of $m$.  We call this the **point-slope** form of a line.  You can experiment with this equation in the figure below.

<iframe scrolling="no" title="Point Slope" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/PdeIue6n/width/620/height/320/border/888888/sfsb/true/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ai/false/asb/false/sri/false/rc/false/ld/false/sdz/false/ctl/false" width="620px" height="320px" style="border:0px;"> </iframe>


## Vertex Form
Lastly, consider $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, which is a transformed version of the square function.  The horizontal and vertical shifts move the vertex to the point $(h, k)$ and the vertical stretch by a factor of $a$ affects the concavity of the graph.  This equation is often referred to as the **vertex form** of a quadratic function.  You can identify the three transformations in the figure below.

<div style="text-align:center">
<iframe scrolling="no" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/uTrJWh1K/width/650/height/350/border/888888/rc/false/ai/false/sdz/false/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ld/false/sri/false/at/auto" width="650px" height="350px" style="border:0px;"> </iframe></div>


## Average Percent Change
Just as we found the average rate of change by averaging the total change over an interval, we can find the **average percent change** of a function by averaging the percent change on $[a, b]$ over the length of the interval.  The formula is

| Average percent change of $f$ on $[a, b]$ $= \frac{\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{f(a)}}{b-a} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{(b-a)f(a)}$ |
| --- |

Since this quantity is a ratio, it is often referred to as the average percent *rate* of change, or simply the **percent rate of change**.  Quantities such as $5%$ per year or $2.3%$ per hour are percent rates of change.

Suppose that $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$.  What's the average percent rate of change of $f$ on the interval $[9, 100]$?  Using the formula above we see that

| $$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{(b-a)f(a)}  = \frac{\sqrt{100}-\sqrt{9}}{(100-9)\sqrt{9}} = \frac{10-3}{(91)3} = \frac{7}{273} \approx 0.02564$$ |
| --- |

This means that from $x=9$ to $x=100$, the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x} $ increases, on average,  by $2.564\%$ every time $x$ increases by $1$.

which we interpret as an average increase of $88.9\%$ every time $x$ increases by $1$.{{% /answer %}}

## Differences
In summary, the first differences of linear functions are constant, the second differences of quadratic functions are constant, and the third differences of cubic functions are constant.

Knowing this will be helpful when we analyze data in [Section 1.8](../1.8).  In particular, we now have the following guidelines:
* If the first differences are nearly constant, then a linear function will fit the data well.
* If the second differences are nearly constant, then a quadratic function will fit the data well.
* If the third differences are nearly constant, then a cubic function will fit the data well.


## Percent Rate of  Change
**TOTAL CHANGE** is just the difference between the beginning and ending values:
$$f(b)-f(a)$$

**PERCENT CHANGE** is the ratio of the total change to the initial value:
$$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{f(a)}$$

**AVERAGE RATE OF CHANGE** is the rate at which the function changes on average over an interval
$$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$

**PERCENT RATE OF CHANGE** is the ratio of the AROC to the initial value
$$\frac{\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}}{f(a)}$$

## Modeling
Throughout this text, a model will usually consist of a function together with a description of its the variables and their units of measure.  Without an accurate description, the function itself is meaningless since there would be no way to relate it to the real world.

Suppose for instance, the height of an object thrown off a 56 foot high cliff with an upward velocity of 4 feet per second can be modeled by the function $h(t)=16 t^2 + 4t + 56$, where $t \geq 0$ is the time in seconds since the object was thrown.  

![](/img/chapter-1/cliff_dive_combo.svg#center)

A professional cliff diver might take that mathematical model and find the x-intercept at $(2, 0)$.  He interprets this to mean he would hit the water 2 seconds after jumping off the cliff.  He can then plan how many flips and twists would be appropriate for those 2 seconds.

Of course, this model is not perfect.  It ignores air resistance, variations in the water level, and any number of additional parameters.  A more sophisticated model could certainly be created that takes those issues into account.  However, for this situation, the simpler model is probably accurate enough, and is more user friendly.
